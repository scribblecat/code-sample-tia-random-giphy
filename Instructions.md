# Tia Technical Challenge iOS
Estimated time commitment: 2-4 hours. The task is not timed and you can work at your own pace.

## Task
Develop an app in Swift or React Native that serves as the mobile client for the GIF hosting site Giphy.com.

## Requirements
All GIFs shall be fetched from the Random Giphy REST API endpoint: `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=9d7dbfe707004b9798b7815c5642d002`. Please refer to the Giphy docs for more information on how to extract these images from the API `https://developers.giphy.com/docs`.

The app shall have a UI that has two columns in which to display GIFs. There shall be 12 GIFs that are fetched and rendered upon loading the app. Once a user scrolls to the bottom of the page, the UI should automatically load and render 4 more GIFs continuously.

The app shall follow the UX theme of Giphy including colors, fonts and styles.

## Deployment
Please include instructions on how one can deploy and run your code.

## Things to consider
We are looking for your understanding of iOS development fundamentals and use of best practices.
Be creative. As long as the above requirements are fulfilled, feel free to optimize or enhance the app in any way.
